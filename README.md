# se330_plushable_plushies

This is an assignment 1 and 2 for SE330: Human Factors and User Interface. 

We are developing an App that is designed to sell plushies called Plushable Plushies. The types of plushies being sold are categorized; Noah's Arc, Furry Friends, Sale, and Old McDonald. There will be multiple features being implemented such as: adding to cart, scrolling through the page, customization for the plushies (this involves what color, name, or any special request), calculating total cost, and adding certain plushies to favorites. 

The design was first made in Adobe XD in order to encapsulate what the app is suppose to look like. There was a LoFi and HiFi mock up that was created, with the HiFi involving a prototyping. Then we continued with making a Story Board, to describe how the use was going to enter using our app.
